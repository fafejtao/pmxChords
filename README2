        https://github.com/fafejtao/pmxChords

The project extends preprocesor musixtex (PMX) to type chords over notes.
New TeX macro is created to type chords.
Use pmxchords.lua script which transpose chords and call pmxab.

The project is opensource

I. project structure

doc      - contains reference table chords and some examples
tex      - contains chords macros - two variants global and for Czech country.

II. Installation

1. pre-requisite
I suppose you have installed musixtex, pmx, musixflx, musixlyr.
see
http://icking-music-archive.org/software/indexmt6.html

2. install chords macros

Copy files tex/chords*.tex to your home ~/texmf/tex/generic/pmxChords dir.
Than call texhash command.

3. install pmxchords.lua script

pmxchords.lua require class ChordsTr.lua
It is require to copy ChordsTr into lua package.path directory.
You can create your own lua package directory:
- create lua folder in your home directory
- set up your LUA_PATH property. Full path is required - do not use ~/lua !
  e.g. add following line into you .bashrc file.
  export LUA_PATH="/home/[user]/lua/?.lua;;"
- copy ChordsTr.lua into ~/lua directory

4. try type the noel from example. I recommend to use pmx2pdf script (at least version 0.3.0) with parameter -c.

$ cd example/noel/aj_co_to_hlasaju
$ pmx2pdf -c -p aj_co_to_hlasaju

The noel is in original signature F-major.
Try to edit file aj_co_to_hlasaju.pmx and modify lines

\input chordsCZ     % chords input czech - B is displayed as H, Bf is displayed as B
%\input chords     % chords default - B -> B, Bf -> Bf

Next uncomment line
K-2+2

Call again 
$ pmx2pdf -c -p aj_co_to_hlasaju

The noel is in transposed signature D-major.
The chords is in czech format. It means the bar number 13 contains chords Hmi instead of Bmi.
