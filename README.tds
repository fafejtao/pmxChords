Pmxchords extends the PMX preprocesor for musixtex to output chord
notations over the notes. The syntax for chord symbols is as inline
tex commands in the .pmx file. 
e.g. \ch.C.\ c44 e \ch.G7.\ d2 | \ch.C.\ c r /

PMX supports key transposition and the pmxchords.lua script is
used to transpose chord symbols accordingly (and then call pmxab as
usual to generate a .tex file). From version 0.3, the pmx2pdf script
in the PMX package supports a -c option to use pmxchords (and then
pmxab) as the preprocessor (rather than pmxab directly).

For installation and usage, see the pmxchords-install document.
