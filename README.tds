Pmxchords extends the PMX preprocesor for musixtex to output chord
notations over the notes. The syntax for chord symbols is as inline
tex commands in the .pmx file. 
e.g. \ch.C.\ c44 e \ch.G7.\ d2 | \ch.C.\ c r /

PMX supports key transposition and the pmxchords.lua script is
used to transpose chord symbols accordingly (and then call pmxab as
usual to generate a .tex file). From version 0.3, the pmx2pdf script
in the PMX package supports a -c option to use pmxchords (and then
pmxab) as the preprocessor (rather than pmxab directly).

For installation and usage, see the pmxchords-install document.

ChangeLog:

version 2.0.2: 2014-04-21
               fixed transposition problem:
               If song began in E-minor and signature is changed in half of song to A-minor
               transposition must be omitted.

version 2.0.1: 2013-12-13
               Fixed:
                - pmxchords.lua now loads correctly the ChordsTr module to make it work on Windows systems.
                - pmxchords.lua does not remove the temporary file pmxaerr.dat
                  that is required by Bob Tennent's pmx2pdf script.

version 2.0.0: 2013-12-09 - rewrite code from perl to lua.

version 1.0:  2012-03-16 - first version written in perl scripting language
