The project extends preprocesor musixtex (PMX) to type chords over notes.
New TeX macro is created to type chords.
It is possible to use perl script scripts/chords_transpose.pl to transpose chords to required key signature.

The project is opensource
LICENSE: GPLv2+

I. project structure

scripts  - contains chords transposition scripts and other useful script.
doc      - contains reference table chords
example  - contains some source example (.pmx files) and generated pdf files.
tex      - contains chords macros - two variants global and for Czech country.
work     - contains generator chords macros and ref tables.

II. Installation

1. pre-requisite
I suppose you have installed musixtex, pmx, musixflx, musixlyr.
see
http://icking-music-archive.org/software/indexmt6.html

2. install chords macros

Copy files tex/chords*.tex to your home ~/texmf/tex/musixtex/pmxChords dir.
After copy the files you must call texhash command.

You can use install.sh script.

3. try type the noel from example. I recommend to use prepared script pmx_dvi.sh or pmx_pdf.sh.

$ cd example/noel/aj_co_to_hlasaju
$ pmx_dvi.sh aj_co_to_hlasaju

The noel is in original signature F-major.
Try to edit file aj_co_to_hlasaju.pmx and modify lines

\input chordsCZ     % chords input czech - B is displayed as H, Bf is displayed as B
%\input chords     % chords default - B -> B, Bf -> Bf

Next uncomment line
K-2+2

Call again 
$ pmx_dvi.sh aj_co_to_hlasaju

The noel is in transposed signature D-major.
The chords is in czech format. It means the bar number 13 contains chords Hmi instead of Bmi.


I will try to describe how to use scripts scripts/pmx_dvi.sh or scripts/pmx_dvi.sh.

The script file require one parameter. File name without .pmx suffix.
a) chords transposition script chords_transpose.pl is called.
b) pmx preprocesor is called (the .tex file is created)
c) musixtex three steps is called
- tex
- musixflx
- tex
