I. Installation

1. pre-requisite
I suppose you have installed musixtex, pmx, musixflx, musixlyr.
see
http://icking-music-archive.org/software/indexmt6.html

2. install chords macros

Copy files texmf/tex/chords*.tex to your home texmf/tex dir.
After copy the files you must call texhash command.

You can use install.sh script.

3. try type some example notes. I recommend to use prepared script pmx_dvi.sh or pmx_pdf.sh.

$ cd example/noel/aj_co_to_hlasaju
$ pmx_dvi.sh aj_co_to_hlasaju

The noel is in original signature F-major.
Try to edit file aj_co_to_hlasaju.pmx and modify lines

\input chordsCZ     % chords input czech - B is displayed as H, Bf is displayed as B
%\input chords     % chords default - B -> B, Bf -> Bf

Next uncomment line
K-2+2

Call again 
$ pmx_dvi.sh aj_co_to_hlasaju

The noel is in transposed signature D-major.
The chords is in czech format. It means the bar number 13 contains chords Hmi instead of Bmi.



I will try to describe how to use scripts bin/pmx_dvi.sh or bin/pmx_dvi.sh.

The script file require one parameter. File name without .pmx suffix.
a) chords transposition script chords_transpose.pl is called.
b) pmx preprocesor is called (the .tex file is created)
c) musixtex three steps is called
- tex
- musixflx
- tex


II. project structure

bin      - contains chords transposition scripts and other useful script.
doc      - contains reference table chords and generated examples in pdf
example  - contains some source example (.pmx files)
texmf    - contains chords macros - two variants global and for Czech country.
